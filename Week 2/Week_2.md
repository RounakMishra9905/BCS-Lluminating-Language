# Week 2 : Transformer Application

This week, you'll learn how to leverage transformer models for sentiment analysis, using HuggingFace's library. You'll work with pre-trained models for inference and also fine-tune them on your dataset to potentially improve their performance.. </br>


## Task :

Transformers from huggingface can be inferenced using 2 methods:

1. Using the HuggingFace Pipeline API directly 
2. Making a custom pipeline to inference models 

In this week's assignment you need to perform sentiment analysis on last weeks dataset using:
1. Pretrained Transformer models (atleast 2)
2. Fine-tuned models(same as above) on our dataset( You'll have to finetune them)

### Deliverables:
1. **Jupyter Notebook**, containing all the code for the task in section wise format.
2. **Markdown File:**

    - Analyze the results of the pre-trained models and the fine-tuned models.
    - Discuss the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and any observations.
    - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
