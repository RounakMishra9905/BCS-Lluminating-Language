LiFi: Visible Light Communication

Li-Fi, formally known as Visible Light Communication, is a portmanteau of “Light” and “Wi-Fi”. It relies on using visible light for transmission of data, instead of radio waves, which are used in the conventional Wi-Fi system. As a cutting-edge technology, it is now finding its place throughout the globe in various applications, both research and industrial alike; mostly due to its economical feasibility, immense scalability and supreme efficiency.
Our project, albeit preliminary, is a comprehensive proof of concept, with optimized circuitry and an elaborate communication protocol implemented in unison to successfully demonstrate the transfer of various types of files (.txt, .jpg, .pdf, etc) at an unforeseen speed.

Our Technical Achievements

Initial Stages
In the initial stages of the project we tried and tested a large number of procedures, processes, components and circuit-designs. Since, this is a growing field in which a lot of research is under progress, we came across a few papers and open-source projects, however, none could help us out. Thus, we embarked on our journey to implement everything from scratch.

Hardware Development
The first true milestone was when we were able to generate square wave-forms on both sides which enabled us to accurately transfer encoded data from transmitter to receiver. And hence, the first working prototype for Li-Fi was on its way.

Custom File Protocol
We had initially started with implementing a one-way system for transmitting a string from one device to another. Currently we are using our FTP2.0 which has an acknowledgement system and supports two-way communication. It is capable of transferring files of any format.

Development of a Working Prototype
After we developed the Custom File Transfer Protocol v2, we turned our attention to testing and optimizations which resulted in a complete working prototype which, in its initial stages itself, allowed file transfer at a speed of 400bps and over a distance of 15cm and was successfully tested with several files and 0% data corruption was observed.

Attainment of speed of 2kbps
Thanks to the upgrades in our hardware and optimization of out software logic, we were able to achieve the above mentioned speed of 2kbps.

Attainment of a distance of 1ft
With the development of a custom LED panel we have been able to increase the distance of transmission to 1ft.

FPGA BASED EMULATION OF QUANTUM ALGORITHMS

INTRODUCTION
This project aims to emulate the behavior of a real quantum system, capable of running quantum algorithms on FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array) while maintaining their natural time complexity.

Quantum Fourier transform and Grover’s search are chosen to be implemented in this project since they are the core of many useful quantum algorithms. Physical realization of a quantum computer is proving to be extremely challenging. Only small scale small-scale quantum computation implementations have been achieved. This project aims to emulate these small scale quantum computations because of the significant improvements in time over classical computations.

HARDWARE USED
FPGA Board XUPV5 LX110T 
USB JTAG

Roadmap
Learning Verilog & reading quantum algorithms.
Implement Grover Search in C & FPGA board.
Implement QFT in C & Verilog.
Implement QFT on FPGA Board.

INSPIRATION
Quantum algorithms run on quantum computers, their processing speeds improve exponentially compared to their classical
counterparts. Quantum computers has Qubit instead of classical bit which can hold superpositions of 0 and 1. For example, as shown in picture If we want to find prime factors of a very large number which is used in encryption. This is nearly impossible for classical computer but quantum computer can do it in 100 sec. Parallel computing in Quantum computers allows this to happen so fast. So we want to emulate such system where parallelism similar to quantum computers can be simulated. Software simulation cannot use the intrinsic parallelism of quantum algorithms eﬃciently. To address the problem, the hardware emulation of quantum algorithms is considered here.

SMART GAMER

About Our Project
Computer games are a popular consumer electronics item. The game players find it captivating to interact with games via joysticks, buttons, trackballs, or wired gloves. They may find it even more engaging to interact through natural, unencumbered hand or body motions. A computer vision-based user interface could provide these capabilities. Computer games represent a possible mass-market application for computer vision. So in this project we exploit this mass-market application and try to build and interactive game which can be controlled using a particular object and also build an AI which can play the game on its own.

Our Approach
01.Object Detection
Using OpenCV to control actions in the game using a particular object for which the model is trained

02.Pygame
Using PyGame, which is a good library to make simple 2-D games like space shooter etc.

03.Game AI
Using Behaviour Tree which is a mathematical model of plan execution which describes switching between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion & Reinforcement Learningn using which Q and DQ-Network models were applied to game

04.Game With Depth Sensing
Using Intel RealSense camera which tracks the 3-D movements and helps play game using our gestures

WITRACK
Through Wall Tracking Using Body Radio Reflections

ABOUT US
​WiTrack is a device that tracks the 3-D motion of the user from the radio signals reflected off their body. It works even if the person is occluded from the WiTrack device or in a different room.  WiTrack does not require the user to wear any kind of wearable device. It transmits wireless signals whose power is significantly lower than Wi-Fi or cellular transmissions. It can be incorporated into consumer electronics and has a wide set of applications.

The device transmits a radio signal and uses its reflections to estimate the time it takes the signal to travel from the transmitting antenna to the reflecting object and back to each of the receiving antennas. WiTrack then uses its knowledge of the position of the antennas to create a geometric reference model, which maps the round trip delays observed by the receive antennas to a 3D position of the reflecting body.

WORKFLOW & FUTURE TASKS
​A simplistic way to look at the model we implemented is by referring to the flowchart shown below.
In near future, we would attempt to miniaturize our model, thereafter generate a heat map of the human body in real time,and finally manifest a gesture control application through the same.

EMG: Hand Gesture Recognition
AFROZ ALAM, KRUTIKA KALKAL, JISHANT SINGH, SAGAR CHAND, KUNAL KAPILA
Wearable technology is the future of electronics gadgets. As interesting as it seems, it has myriad applications. This project aims at creating one such prototype, a hand gesture recognition system, using electromyography. Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by the skeletal muscles. The basics of EMG are used to design a circuit that takes the differential signals from two electrodes placed on the same muscle at different locations as input, with one electrode as bone reference. The circuit pre-amplifies the input signal, filters the resultant signal for noise, rectifies it, and finally amplifies it. This output signal is then fed to a machine learning algorithm, which associates different signals with different data, and hence different gestures, and this can be utilized further to integrate with objects, that can be controlled using the gesture recognition system.

FPGA Based Audio Processor
Ganesh Seelam, Mounica Nagavalli, Pratik Bhangale, Sri Krishna
If we consider the situation of attending a party, our ears capture numerous sounds: a friend’s voice, the voices of others, background music, ringing telephones, and many others. If one concentrates, one can hear what a person is saying and you will filter any other sound. One can also change his/her focus of attention. For example, one may pay attention to your friend’s speech first and shift focus to the music if it is playing a song you like. If we were to record these sources by placing microphones in many places inside the room, the playback would be jumbled mix of sounds. One might be able to pick out a few words here and there, but there is no way one would be able to hear the conversation details. We are going to achieve this audio mapping using FPGA based circuit.

Gesture Recognization Using IMU
Shubham Sharma, Piyush Tayal, Shubham Jain
We will put IMU sensor on hand band and then using this sensor we will calculate the trajectory of the hand and then plot the graph of position of hand with respect to time. This data tells the application what the user is doing with their hand. With the help of machine learning we will pre-­‐set the poses to perform specific task in the computer when the certain task is being performed. The IMU sensor will give us a data of certain pose and then the machine will predict which task is to be executed.

EMG: Hand Gesture Recognition
AFROZ ALAM, KRUTIKA KALKAL, JISHANT SINGH, SAGAR CHAND, KUNAL KAPILA
The idea of the project is to represent various frequencies present in the audio input signal on a led matrix using FPGA. We will first take an audio input signal an convert it into a digital signal using ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). And then use Fourier transformations on the signals to obtain the coefficients for the various frequencies present in the audio input. Then finally we will represent the output on an LED matrix using Persistence of Vision. The FPGA will be useful as it allows parallel processing of the input signal while applying Fourier transformations.

Hardik Soni,Saurabh Kataria,Akshay Kumar,Shivam Agarwal
A LED cube is like a LED screen , but it is special as it has 3D. We can think it as of low resolution displays. In normal displays it is normal to stack pixels closer to each other in order for better resolution but LED cube has its limits. LED cube rely on optical phenomenon called Persistence of vision. If you flash a LED really fast it will remain in your retina for some time even after LED is switched off. By flashing each layer of cube very fast after one another it gives the feeling of 3d animations.

AssistU
Enayat Ullah, Ishaan Kumar, Vishal, Anshul Goyal
Do you often miss out several important events because you simply forget about them? 'ASSIST U' is an android app which eases your everyday life by notifying you of things you tend to be forgetful. It's a closed-community(within IITK) tasks and reminder application which has a innate database of geo-coordinates of arguably, all location keywords within IITK, so as soon as you enter your note(containing a location keyword), the keyword is extracted from it and (geo)tagged on to the note saved. It then, incorporates the use of GPS to monitor your current location and chooses to/not to remind you on the premise of your distance from the nearest addressed task. An additional feature is the time-notes, which is similar to straight forward time-based reminders. With the functionality part pragmatic, the UI of the app is kept lucid and alluring with the coalescence of modern android design elements like Swipeable Tabs, Card UI and Drag and Drop. So we assist you so that you don’t miss out anything.

Evo Mouse
Aakash Kardam, Bipin Kumar, Nalin Dhameliya
Evo Mouse, a product which would let people control normal mouse operations just by using their natural hand movements, in short it is a hand gesture controlled device. LED ARRAY and an IR camera was used to achieve it. The camera basically tracks your finger and the mouse follows it. It is obviously more intuitive to use your natural hand gestures and movements to control your cursor movement than pushing a physical mouse. With Evo mouse, move your fingers and the cursor will follow you, tap on any arbitrary surface and it will select, you show two fingers to the camera and it will automatically right click and what not. Inspired with the MOUSELESS project, this is indeed a useful application for people with CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME.

Think of the noisiest places, the quietest places and the busiest places you have been to. How many times have you missed an important call, message or other notification because you couldn't hear the tone or it wasn't appropriate to check your phone? A lot of times, isn’t it? So, we came up with the idea of making a watch that can connect to your smart phone and behave as a mini phone in case your phone is not accessible to you. Android watch reflects what is happening around the world and lets you know. An Android watch is a computerized wrist watch with functionality enhanced beyond timekeeping, often with features comparable to a PDA. They have full mobile phone capability, while others function as mobile media players, with playback of FM radio and audio and video files, with sound via Bluetooth headset and many more. It comprises of Arduino and LCD shield connected to a smart phone with the help of a Bluetooth module and an Android app.

Balancing Platform
Aarhee Mishra, Ankit Raj, Ish Kumar Jain, Piyush Jain, Shubham Kumar
A self-balancing platform consists of platform which is balanced by movement of three motors in opposite direction to the movement of the base at the bottom which supports the motors. So it doesn't matter the angle you put the lower base in, the upper platform will ever stay in the horizontal position (waiter’s delight). The base consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) which can be used like a remote. When it is detached from base and triggered, it can control the above platform(It can be used to handle hulky cameras).

FPGA Calculator
Ankit Jalan, Kavita Meena, Manu Seth
FPGAs contain programmable logic components called "logic blocks", and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be "wired together"—somewhat like many (changeable) logic gates that can be inter-wired in (many) different configurations. Logic blocks can be configured to perform complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic gates like AND and XOR. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. FPGA’s have logic blocks, input-out ports and interconnects which are programmable, which provides flexibility to the range of logic circuits which can be configured on the board.
